598
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,260
a lot of you would probably not trigger gpu
你们很多人可能不会触发gpu

599
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,980
so that's far
这是远

600
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,020
and so some of this will sound like goblin google

601
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,020
that's okay

607
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,260
one of the things that i cannot recommend enough is

everywhere uh every single object in web g p u has a
到处哦每个对象在网络g p u

610
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,100
label that you can set either creation time or during

631
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,170
we also have a mechanism called feedback groups

632
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,130
and you should use these uh wherever it's appropriate

633
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,770
this is really just a stack of labels uh that you can

634
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,370
push and pop as you go into your command decoder and

640
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,330
we can return the feedback group stack to you and say

641
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,370
this is where you told us you were in your algorithm

642
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,810
so that you can pinpoint where the errors happen better

643
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,380
ah
ah

644
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:19,740
very

645
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,700
very valuable when you're trying to suss out where

647
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:24,490
uh
uh

650
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,610
um
um

651
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,050
one of the common uh patterns that we saw with web g
一个常见的呃模式,我们看到网络g

652
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,250
l was when you want to load an image from a j.peg or p
l是当你想要加载一个图像从j.gp

653
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:39,970
and g
和g

654
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,450
you would put it into an image tag and then push push
你会把它放到一个图像标记,然后推动推动

655
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,450
that image gentleman into text image two d
绅士形象在文本图像两个d

656
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,570
and that would be how you got a texture
那就是你如何有一个纹理

657
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,690
this is a very common pattern
这是一个非常常见的模式

658
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,290
we see it on all the major libraries
我们看到在所有主要的库

659
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,410
it's been happening since the day that what g l existed
从那天起开始发生,什么g l存在

660
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,770
or first existed um
或存在嗯

661
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,050
but you can't quite do that in web g p u
但你不能完全用web g p u

662
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,170
so my time is as a bit of a surprise
所以我的时间是有点奇怪

663
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:01,730
instead
而不是

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,650
you have to pass in image bit maps
你必须通过在图像地图

665
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,810
now you can get an image bit map from an image element
现在你可以得到一个图像的位图的图像元素

666
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,050
but we don't recommend you do that at least in chrome
但是我们不建议你这样做至少在chrome

667
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,130
it turns out that
事实证明,

668
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,610
that forces the decode of the image they happen on
迫使图像的解码他们发生

669
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,690
the main thread
主线程

670
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,530
and so you'll get a bit of a
所以你会得到的

671
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,380
instead
而不是

672

what we recommend is
我们推荐的是

673
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:20,620
ah
啊

674
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,140
anytime you're getting an image from like a u r l
当你得到一个图像从像u r l

675
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,560
just use batch to get it and get a blob out of that and
用批处理来得到它,并得到一个blob

676
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,880
what you can create image payment upon the blog
你可以支付在博客创建图像

677
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,920
this allows it to the code off the main threat
这允许它的代码的主要威胁

678
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,920
and so it's probably the most efficient way to get
所以它可能是最有效的办法

679
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,520
an image or a texture out of a j.peg or a phg
一个图像或一个纹理的j。挂钩或phg

680
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,320
however
however

681
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,900
uh
uh

682
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,180
we really
we really

683
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,500
really
really

684
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,180
真的希望你可以使用压缩纹理
really can prefer that you use compressed textures

685
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,220
而不是
instead

686
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,580
啊
ah

687
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,820
这是可以提到很多关于
this is something that that can mention a lot about

688
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,300
我要喋喋不休
and i'm gonna harp on

689
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,540
更因为它很重要
it's more because it's important

690
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:54,090
呃webgl没有船最好的压缩纹理
uh webgl didn't ship with the best compressed texture

691
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,810
商店任一
store either

692
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,970
支持小片状
support was little flaky

693
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,210
那里的工具并不完全
the tooling wasn't quite there

694
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,290
所以它没有得到那么多的吸收
and so it didn't get quite as much uptake as we would

695
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,210
有喜欢
have liked

696
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,330
但与g p u
but with what g p u

697
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,090
我们真的想要摆脱一个更好的脚本压缩
we really wanna get off on a better foot uh compressed

698
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,810
结构支持将从第一天起
texture support is going to be there from day one

699
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,090
uh
uh

700
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,370
这是需要你支持每一个系统
it's required to be supported on every system you'll

701
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:16,370
嗯一个或两个呃压缩纹理格式
get um either one or two uh compressed texture formats

702
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,090
至少在每个设备
at minimum on every device um

703
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,010
有很多更好的工具
and there's a lot of better tooling in this

704
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,010
现在的生态系统
the ecosystem now

705
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,610
比如可以提到k t x 2的基础上普遍的东西
such as as can mention k t x two basis universal stuff

706
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,330
像这样
like that

707
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,260
这需要更多的代码
now this does take more code

708
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:30,580
uh
uh

709
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,020
这不是完全可以代表
it's not something that can be represented fully

710
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,260
等一个幻灯片嗯的最后一件事
on a slide like the last thing um

711
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,060
但它是值得的
but it is worth it uh

712
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,220
会有
and there's going to be

713
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,700
我我肯定会支持所有主要的库
i i'm sure all the major libraries are going to support

714
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,420
它门
it out the gate

715
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,620
然后我有独立的图书馆
and then i've got standalone library

716
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,500
一个独立的库在底部
a standalone library down at the bottom here that

717
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,420
您可以自由使用或引用或任何你
you are free to use or reference or whatever you'd

718
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:50,940
就像
like

719
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,340
um
um

720
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,580
做最正确的事情喜欢解码了吗
does most of the right things like decoding off on

721
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,140
一个工作线程
a worker thread uh

722
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,500
是非常值得和演示
and it is really worth the effort and to demonstrate

723
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,300
我想做一个快速的案例研究的资产
that i wanted to do a quick case study with one of assets

724
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,340
从幽灵球我刚才演示
from the spooky ball demo that i just showed

725
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,940
这是明
this is the paddle

726
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,500
太小幽灵啊跟随和浮动
it's too little ghost that ah float with a cough and

727
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,020
来回
back and forth

728
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,140
不是很复杂
not terribly complicated

729
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,860
嗯
um

730
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,940
资产本身有五个纹理烤进去哦
the asset itself has five textures baked into it uh

731
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,540
他们都是p和g的
they're all p and g's

732
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,780
他们呃两个k由两个k h
and they're uh two k by two k h

733
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,460
这是荒谬的空间需要吗
which is ridiculous for the amount of space this takes

734
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,140
在屏幕上了
up on the screen

735
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,060
但我们会
but we'll

736
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,020
这出来的blender在大约12个字节
this comes out of blender at about twelve megabytes

737
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,620
这并不是可怕的
which isn't terrible

738
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,380
但可能是更好的
but could be better

739
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,260
um
um

740
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,060
在我的例子中
in my case

741
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,220
我使用一个工具,称为g l t f变换
i use a tool called g l t f transform

742
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,780
有很好的命令行接口
which has really nice command line interface

743
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,820
但也有一个库
but also has a library

744
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,580
如果你想做更多的编程方式
if you want to do it more programmatically

745
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,620
我用它来把所有g l t f跟踪资产和做
and i use that to take all my g l t f track assets and do

746
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,060
纹理编码与k h r结构基础
texture encoding on them with the k h r texture basis

747
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,380
你扩展养犬早些时候提到
you extension the kennel was mentioning earlier

748
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,050
这需要特定资产低于几乎
and this takes this particular asset down from almost

749
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,530
12个字节到一点七
twelve megabytes to one point seven

750
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,210
这是
that is

751
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,170
巨大的减少哦
huge reduction uh

752
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,690
这只是因为材质本身的一部分
part of that is just because the textures themselves

753
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,490
是如此的简单
are so simple

754
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,010
但就像我看到这种风格的减少在每个资产
but like i see this style of reduction on every asset

755
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,810
我上运行这些工具
i run these these tools on

756
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,770
而且
and furthermore

757
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,970
有很多其他相同的转换工具
there's a lot of other transforms that that same tool

758
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,850
可以做哦
can do um

759
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,050
如应用德拉高质量压缩
such as applying drago mass compression more

760
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,600
如果我叠在一起
and if i stack them all up together

761
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,120
包括调整纹理
including resizing the texture

762
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,480
所以他们不是非常巨大
so they're not so ridiculously huge

763
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,640
的资产,我船幽灵球
the asset that i actually ship in spooky ball comes

764
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,240
半杂志
out to about half a mag

765
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,840
就像小于百分之五的原始
which is like less than five percent of the original

766
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,680
大小
size

767
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,920
和大部分是从纹理压缩
and most of that is from texture compression

768
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,640
所以我不能强调如何宝贵的纹理压缩
so i cannot stress enough how valuable texture compression

769
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:36,920
is
is

770
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,240
我希望每一个人去使用这个技术想法
and i want everybody to use it

771
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,700
从第一天开始。
from day one.

772
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,640
从纹理
moving on from textures

773
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,320
的一件事我们gpu的介绍
one of the things that we've gpu introduces that's

774
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,520
不同于webgl有很多
different from webgl is there happens to be a lot of

775
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,240
方法数据缓冲区
ways to get data to buffer

776
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,880
顶点缓冲区
vertex buffers

777
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,480
索引缓冲区
index buffers

778
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:54,880
存储缓冲区
storage buffers

779
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,640
不管哦
whatever uh

780
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,200
这可能有点吓人
and it can be a little intimidating

781
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,480
但有便利函数对自助餐
but there is convenience function called right buffet

782
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,770
当有疑问
and when in doubt

783
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,850
这是从来没有错误的答案
that is never ever the wrong answer

784
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,770
现在你可能认为自己是便利功能
now you might think to yourself as convenience functions

785
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,530
因此
so therefore

786
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,250
它必须有一个缺点
it must have a downside

787
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,170
和我很高兴在这个特殊的案例
and i'm happy to report in this particular case

788
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,130
no
no

789
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,090
不是嗯
not really um

790
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,690
可能有情况你可以构造
there are probably scenarios where you could construct

791
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:21,730
一个更好的上传管道为一个特定的场景
a better upload pipeline for a specific scenario

792
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,810
使用一些其他的机制
using some of the other mechanisms

793
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,570
但实际上
but really

794
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,570
你应该下降
you should fall

795
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,090
你应该先试着正确的缓冲区,只走过去
you should try right buffer first and only go past

796
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,730
如果你发现这是一个瓶颈
that if you find that it's a bottleneck

797
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,650
特别是在使用类似的情况
and especially in the case of using something like

798
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,290
网络大会
web assembly

799
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,330
对缓冲实际上是首选方法,因为
right buffer is actually the preferred way because

800
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,410
它避免了一个不同的和额外的副本
it avoids a different and additional copy

801
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,610
这是其中的一个例子,使用方便
so this is one of those cases where using the convenience

802
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,650
函数是绝对
function is absolutely

803
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,920
um.
um.

804
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,970
现在的另一个你要的东西
now one of the other things that you're going to be

805
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,490
处理很多web v p u是所谓的管道
dealing with a lot in web v p u is what's called pipelines

806
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,330
这是一大捆的所有状态
this is kind of just a big bundle of all of the state

807
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,450
你曾经是设置在全球1 g p或
that you used to be setting globally in one g p not or

808
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,250
和webg l
one g l

809
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,170
并不是所有的状态
not all of the state

810
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,730
but most of it things like shaders and blend modes
but most of it things like shaders and blend modes

811
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,450
和多边形拓扑和所有这些东西
and polygon topology and all that kind of stuff

812
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,770
你会创造很多
you're gonna create a lot of them

813
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,380
呃
uh

814
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,340
现在有一种同步和异步版本
now there is a synchronous and an asynchronous version

815
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,340
这些函数的
of these functions

816
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,860
啊因为同步是一种空气引号
ah synchronous is kind of an air quotes here because

817
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,300
两个版本将立即返回给你
both versions will return to you immediately

818
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:17,980
呃
uh

819
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,020
然后在后台工作
and then do work in the background

820
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,500
但是缺点与同步版本
but the downside with the synchronous version is

821
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,460
它将给你一个处理管道
it will hand you a handle to the pipeline

822
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,780
你可以转身立即使用它
and you can turn around and use it immediately to either

823
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,420
渲染或调度计算
render or dispatch compute

824
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,620
如果你这样做
and if you do that

825
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,340
你的用户会看到大量喝他们的表现
your users will see a massive drink in their performance

826
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,620
因为机会是管道还没有准备好使用
because chances are the pipeline is not ready to use

827
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,700
除非它是
unless it was

828
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,470
和。
and.

829
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,640
你
you

830
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,920
你的g p u将你派遣
your g p u will hit that point where you've dispatched

831
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,520
工作,就停下来等待管道
work to it and just stop and wait for the pipeline to

832
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,960
完成编译材质
finish compiling shader

833
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,840
无论它之前需要做可以继续
whatever else it needs to do before it can continue

834
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,040
这可能看起来像一千五百毫秒
this will probably look like a five hundred millisecond

835
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,240
垃圾给用户
junk to a user

836
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,560
根据管道的复杂性
depending on the complexity of the pipeline

837
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,540
而不是
instead

838
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,580
如果你能喜欢
if you can like

839
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:05,780
说
say

840
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,220
在负载的屏幕上,你不需要
during the load screen where you're not needing to

841
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,820
使用管道
use the pipeline

842
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,420
相同的框架创建
the same frame that was created

843
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,020
您应该使用这些因为我认为版本
you should use the i think version of these because

844
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,740
他们会保证结果返回给管道
they'll return promise that results to the pipeline

845
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,580
当承诺解决
and when that promise resolves

846
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,420
管道是保证可以使用
the pipeline is guaranteed to be ready to use without

847
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,740
过度的停顿
undue stalling

848
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,220
所以你可以转身立即使用它
so you can turn around and use it immediately

849
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,700
你不应该得到接近相同的类型
and you should not get anywhere near the same type

850
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,740
杰克,你将和其他
of jake that you would with the other

851
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,440
嗯。
um.

852
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:37,050
夫妇的最后哦去这里的最佳实践
couple of last uh best practices to go over here

853
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,490
对不起
excuse me

854
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,530
关于管道嗯
regarding pipelines um

855
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,210
我们有一个机制被称为隐式管道布局
is we have a mechanism called implicit pipeline layouts

856
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,590
嗯。
um.

857
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,330
至少在那一刻
at least at the moment

858
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,530
我们还讨论这一点
we're still discussing this one a little bit

859
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,050
这是另一个方便的机制
and this is another convenience mechanism

860
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,170
但与正确的缓冲
but unlike right buffer

861
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,050
这是你应该小心的方法之一
it's one that you should approach with caution

862
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,290
呃
uh

863
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,810
隐式管道布局很好当你
implicit pipeline layouts are really nice when you're

864
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,290
做一个完全隔离的材质
doing a shader that is completely isolated

865
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,290
不与任何其他分享数据
it doesn't really share data with anything else

866
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,130
这是罕见的
which is rare

867
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,410
不可否认
admittedly

868
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,090
嗯
um

869
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,290
但是你可以说
but then you can just say

870
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:08,730
哦
oh

871
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:13,090
我想要你编译材质,给
i want to have you compile the shader and just give

872
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,690
我为我所有的布局哦买组信息
me a layout for all of my uh buying group information

873
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,770
这是缓冲区
which is buffers

874
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,690
纹理
textures

875
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,250
取样器
samplers

876
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,650
东西只是生成对我哦,
stuff like that just generate that for me uh and it

877
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,170
作品
works

878
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,970
它很有效
and it works fairly well

879
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,770
嗯
um

880
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,250
但是有缺点
but there's downsides to it

881
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:26,730
呃
uh

882
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,210
最大的一个是你不能分享购买
the biggest one is you can't actually share buying

883
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,890
您创建的组对隐式管道
groups that you create against the implicit pipeline

884
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,770
布局与其他管道
layout with any other pipelines

885
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,490
这不利于性能
which is bad for performance

886
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,530
然后另一件事
and then the other thing

887
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:36,810
啊
ah

888
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,370
可能更重要的是它们能布局
probably more significant is that they can the layouts

889
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,370
可以改变意外当你更新吗
can change unexpectedly while you're updating the

890
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:42,970
着色器
shader

891
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,830
它也许不总是直观的
and it's maybe not always intuitive as to how it's

892
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,830
改变下
changed beneath

893
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,280
在表面下
beneath the surface

894
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,840
这可能有点难调试,可以
so it can be a little bit difficult to debug and can

895
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,440
造成很大的挫折
cause a lot of frustration

896
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,360
这是一个机制,你真的应该方法
so this is a mechanism that you really should approach

897
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,640
相当谨慎,更喜欢使用显式的
fairly sparingly and really prefer to use explicit

898
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,400
购买集团布局
buying group layout

899
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
嗯
um

900
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,720
我要邮政通过这些最后的几张幻灯片
i'm going to zip through these last few slides really

901
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,040
快速
quick

902
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,080
so we can move on to next
so we can move on to next

903
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,400
但基本上
but basically

904
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,720
当你宣布嗯的布局信息
whenever you're declaring um the layout of the information

905
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,240
你将进入一个着色器
that you're going to pass into a shader

906
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,120
你用所谓的购买群体布局
you're using something called buying group layout

907
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,460
你可以显式地声明这些或者你
and you can explicitly declare these or you you will

908
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,900
通常只是这些,然后创建显式地声明
usually just explicitly declare these and then create

909
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,060
从这些和购买群体的实际资产
buying groups of the actual assets from those and

910
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,460
这样做的好处是你可以分享
the benefit of doing this is that you can then share

911
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,020
布局之间的多个不同的渲染管道
that layout between multiple different render pipelines

912
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,260
多个渲染状态
multiple render states

913
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:33,930
呃
uh

914
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,010
这样做它
and by doing it

915
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,290
你在哪里把同一组裁员和相同的槽
where you put same by group layoffs and the same slot

916
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,010
在每一个渲染管道
in every render pipeline

917
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,890
你可以得到一个看起来有点渲染循环
you can get to a render loop that looks a little bit

918
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,770
像这样
like this

919
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,850
在那里我去说
where i go and say

920
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,050
嘿
hey

921
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,610
我有这组共同制服像相机啊
i've got this set of common uniforms like camera ah

922
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,250
未来的度量矩阵视图
prospective matrix view metrics

923
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,170
诸如此类的
stuff like that

924
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,170
,我要把它在我的开始
and i'm just gonna set it once at the beginning of my

925
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:55,930
渲染循环
render loop

926
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,730
然后其他管道将能够使用它
and then every other pipeline will be able to use it

927
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,330
是哦
as is uh

928
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,050
这是一个大规模的状态量的减少
this is a mass reduction in the amount of state that

929
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,930
你需要设置哦
you need to set uh

930
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,570
特别是当你有这就是共享
especially when you got something that's just shared

931
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,370
之间的一切
between everything

932
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,370
真正的模式,你应该看看
and it's really the pattern that you should be looking

933
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,970
当你试图和提高性能
for when you're trying to improve performance and

934
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,330
通过g p呈现
by g p rendering

935
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,330
这是我们推荐的一大原因
so that's one of the big reasons why we really recommend

936
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,690
你管理自己的布局
that you managed your own uh layout

937
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,680
这就是我今天有时间
and that's all i have time for today

938
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,000
呃
uh

939
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,600
所以非常感谢你
so thank you very much

940
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:24,960
呃
uh

941
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,320
我要继续哦写信息
i'm going to continue uh writing up information about

942
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,880
最佳实践,将它们放在网上
best practices and publish them online

943
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,320
嗯
um

944
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,280
你将能够找到那些当我发布它们
you'll be able to find those when i publish them at

945
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,240
我的twitter账户哦或者呃的联系我
my twitter account uh or uh the links that i got on this

946
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,520
去年这边
last side here

947
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,440
如果你有问题专门为我
and if you have questions specifically for me

谢谢你！
thank you

950
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,510
现在,我相信我们会手去解决
and now i believe we're going to hand off to tackle

951
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,190
英雄

这就像一个英雄现在在日本
so it's like a hero is in japan right now

962
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,950
这是一个非常
and it's a a very

963

对他很疯狂的小时
very crazy hour for him

964
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,910
所以他没能参加他将呃完全和生活
so he wasn't able to attend live and he will be uh perfectly

965
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,070
展示他的在线编辑器摆动
presenting his online wiggle editor

966

我现在在日本的产假
i'm on parental leave in japan now

971
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,490
所以我事先我录这个视频
so i i recorded this video beforehand

972
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,810
我希望我能加入国内媒体时间
i wish i could join the media at home time

973
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,100
无论如何
anyway

975
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,740
这是一个这是一个新的web g p u脱落语言
it is a it is a new shedding a language for web g p u

976
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,060
没有
no

977
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,380
我希望别人在媒体上已经解释道
i expect uh someone else in the media has already explained

978
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,780
什么
what

979
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,940
所以问题
so question

980
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,620
怎么你想学习一个新的脱落语言
how do you want to study a new shedding language

981
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,860
你不想做实际编写代码
don't you want to do it by actually writing the code

982
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,460
和看到的影响,好消息
and seeing the effects and good news

983
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,820
我做了一个在线w g s l编辑器
i made an online w g s l editor

984
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,860
它是生命编码编辑器
it is life coding editor

985
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,980
您可以测试w g s l
you can test w g s l on it

986
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,050
呃
uh

987
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,050
它运行在您的web浏览器
it runs on your web browsers

988
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:10,930
你不需要
you don't need to

989
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,090
你不需要安装任何只是访问
you don't need to install anything but just access

990
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:14,770
网络
the web

991
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:15,090
呃
uh

992
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,090
编辑web应用程序的页面
the editor web application page

993
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,080
因此,更多的时间。
so the more time.

994
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,340
这是与应用程序页面编辑器
this is editor with application page

995
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,060
如果您将鼠标指针移到窗口
now if you move the mouse pointer into the window

996
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,500
呃
uh

997
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,820
编辑器显示
the editor shows up

998
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,460
如果你搬出来
if you move it out

999
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,260
编辑器是隐藏的,你可以看效果
the editor is hidden and you can watch the effects

1000
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,380
更清楚地
more clearly

1001
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:43,750

left became error

1015
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,600
如果你点了错误的代码
and if you point the highlighted wrong code

1016
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,840
你可以看到代码的原因是错误的
you can you can see the reason why the code is wrong

1017

编辑器
the editor

1045
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,790
因为你只有在chrome上运行
since you run on only on chrome

让我我的名字是雅马哈桑切斯
for having me my name is yamaha sanchez

1089
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,930
我u我工程师做可视化
i'm u i engineer uh doing visualization at this point

1090
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,180
但我确实在黑暗的小时创造困难
but i do create difficulty in the dark hours of the

1091
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:37,780
晚上嗯
night um

1092
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,580
我要对我的过程和我解释

1093
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:40,980
在
been up to

1094
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,770
嗯
um

1095
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,570
所以第一个问题是为什么创造性的编码
so in the first question would be why creative coding

1096
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,530
也许他们为什么不创造性的编码
and probably they're why not creative coding

1097
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,650
所以在某种程度上
so in a way

1098
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,090
呃
uh

1099
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,610
创造性的编码是是一种释放
creative coding is is quite liberating in the sense

1100
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,130
哦没有一定的路线图
that uh there's no necessarily road map

1101
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,850
没有交付
there's no deliveries

1102
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,330
没有
there are no

1103
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,010
好你的

嗯
um

1105
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,050
你可以设定自己的目标,和,并满足他们
you can set your own goals and and and and meet them

1106
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:05,930
以自己的节奏
at your own pace

1107
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:06,450
嗯
um

1108
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,130
你可以设置你的约束
you can set your your constraints

1109
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,450
你可以设置你的期望
you can set your expectations

1110
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,890
which is is deliberating
which is is deliberating

1111
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,050
它是在同一时间
it's at the same time

1112
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,330
这是充实的
it's fulfilling

1113
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,830
能够达到有意识或者无意识
being able to reach consciously or unconsciously

1114
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:19,630
嗯或皮尔斯和副有趣的事情
uh or by pierce and deputy interesting things

1115
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,630
这也是也是相当好
it's also it's also quite good

1116
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,150
它基本上是很有趣
and it's basically it's fun

1117
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,550
它真的很有趣
it's it's really fun

1118
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:29,390
所以我要解释我的过程
so i'm going to explain my process

1119
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,870
this is not necessarily something that applies to
this is not necessarily something that applies to

1120
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,470
每一个人
everyone

1121
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:32,950
呃
uh

1122
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,590
每个人都有自己的方式处理与网络
everyone has their own way of dealing with with web

1123
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,430
发展和和有这样的工具哦
development and and and there are tools um like this

1124
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,270
一个适合我
one works for me

1125
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,190
不规范的
it's not prescriptive

1126
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,310
不应该有任何如何如何
there's not meant to be any any exactly how uh how to

1127
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,350
uh
uh

1128
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,550
所以使用一个编辑
so use an editor

1129
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,670
使用visual studio代码
use visual studio code

1130
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,430
我使用一个服务器
i use a server

1131
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,430
无论服务器哦
whatever server uh

1132
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,230
是什么原因
what's the reason

1133
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,110
我的平台
my platform

1134
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:57,110
在这种情况下,python或注意服务器chrome
in this case a python or a note server chrome as

1135
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,660
通常像三js框架或库
and usually a framework or library like three js is

1136
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,820
真的有用得到很多网站的代码
really useful to get a lot of the website code out of

1137
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,180
的方式和关注你可以哦
the way and focus on on what you can actually uh deal

1138
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:08,620
与
with

1139
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,060
呃
uh

1140
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,140
我不使用n p m
i don't use n p m

1141
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,460
我用的包
i use bundles

1142
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,940
没有类型三个编译器
no type three compiler

1143
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,700
没有生活
no livelihood

1144
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,460
一切
everything

1145
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,300
我认为它阻碍了
all that i think it gets in the way

1146
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,580
但每个人都能给每个人一个流
but everyone can give everyone a flow

1147
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,780
所以我有一个结构的方式
so the way the way i have a structure

1148
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:26,460
我通常有一个模板哦哦的复制粘贴
i usually have a template uh with uh with a copy paste

1149
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,540
然后我从那里开始
and then i start going from there

1150
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,380
这是一个指数h d m l
it's an index h d m l

1151
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,900
它有一个主模块,进口一些功能
it's got a main module that imports some functions

1152
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,660
已经很好,给我一个渲染场景
that are already fine that give me a render a scene

1153
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,740
和角度相机
and perspective camera

1154
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,740
我可以调整注册处理程序
i can register resize handlers

1155
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,700
我可以注册更新
i can register updates

1156
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,860
负载模型环境地图在明年
load models environment maps in next year

1157
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,700
我哦
i uh

1158
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,540
一些看到了一些,似乎是一个多维数据集实践
some seen some that seems like a cube practice

1159
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,260
并从那里
and from there

1160
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:54,620
呃
uh

1161
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,340
你可以开始编码
you can start the coding

1162
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,330
所以如果你喜欢
so if you ever be like

1163
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,050
你从哪里开始
where do you start

1164
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,530
他们想要的东西,一旦你得到一个主意
what what they want once you get an idea

1165
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,890
所以如果你没有一个主意
so or if you don't have an idea

1166
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,090
通常你会发现它很有趣的东西
so usually you would find something that it it's interesting

1167
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:11,010
呃,你想复制或涉及的东西
uh that you wanna replicate or something that comes

1168
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,570
或者有些纸
to mind or somewhat paper or something

1169
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:16,210
但有灵感之类的提示
but there's inspiration on on things like prompts

1170
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,450
所以这里黄金会员或正确的
so that here's where things like gold member or right

1171
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:18,970
现在
now

1172
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:19,410

1174
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:23,130
对不熟悉的人哦
it's uh for people that are not familiar with this

1175
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,050
在一个月
during a month

1176
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:26,850
有一个有一个挑战的东西
there's a there's a challenge of getting something

1177
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:31,410
每天每日的基础上在一个提示
daily based on on on one prompt per day one

1178
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,410
一个
one

1179
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,290
一个主题可以还有11月搅拌器
one subject you can there's also november for blender

1180
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,650
但你可以橙色多佛
but you can be orange dover

1181
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:37,410
这是绘画
which is for painting

1182
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,330
但你可以把它
but you can take it

1183
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,530
你可以把这些或自己
you can take any of this or come up with your own

1184
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:41,910
嗯
um

1185
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,550
还有你可以找到灵感在你的社会
there's also you can find inspirations on your social

1186
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,350
媒体提要像instagram哦
media feeds like to your instagram uh

1187
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,070
下面我推荐的人不要做你
i recommend following people that don't do what you

1188
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,830
通常喜欢插图或游戏开发
usually do like illustration or game development

1189
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,670
你从你的地区
something that is out of your your area

1190
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,430
嗯
um

1191
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,430
这就像给你前进的能量相同
that's like the same energy that give you move forward

1192
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,390
有兴趣哦
there's interest uh

1193
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,790
嗯你甚至可以像罗斯n f t画廊
there's uh you can even like rose n f t galleries

1194
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,110
有一些发现
there's something to be found

1195
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,810
在为谷歌图片事件,嗯就像如果你开始
in in that um for google images event like if you start

1196
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,490
寻找的东西
searching for something

1197
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,170
嗯
um

1198
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,170
你可以找到相关的图片
you can find related images

1199
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,050
你可以找到有趣的需要在概念上
you can find interesting takes on on on on concepts

1200
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,930
数学概念或类似的东西
mathematical concepts or things like that

1201
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,220
所以我的方法令人吃惊
so my approach startling

1202
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,580
只是去开始做一些模块
just get there started doing something in that modules

1203
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,300
和功能你需要它们,因为你不是
and function as you need them uh because you're not

1204
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,020
再次试图建立
trying to build again

1205
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,820
提到你不试图建立呃呃框架
mentioning you're not trying to build uh uh framework

1206
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,900
在理想的情况下
ideally

1207
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,820
所以一旦你理解了这个团队
so once you've got that team that

1208
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,820
这一目标
that goal

1209
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,500
就像去
just like go for it

1210
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,060
构建它
build it

1211
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,460
呃
uh

1212
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,260
随时像我下或删除它
feel free to like me under or drop it

1213
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,820
你觉得你在浪费你的时间
you feel like you're wasting your time

1214
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,540
其他东西会
something else will come

1215
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,020
也许你会发现一些隐藏的黄金,你可以探索
maybe you find some hidden gold that you can explore

1216
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,700
那不是你最初打算做什么
that wasn't on what you initially intended to do it

1217
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,760
真是太好
it's so good

1218
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,160
真是太好
it's so good

1219
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,560
这就是为什么你的期望只设定的误差
that's why your expectations are set by error only

1220
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,440
对你来说
for you to be set

1221
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,520
然后
so then

1222
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,080
是我多年来的事情
as things that i've been over the years

1223
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,560
建筑哦,是有用的
building uh and are useful

1224
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,000
比如
so for instance

1225
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,520
我呃函数分布的数据
i have uh functions for distribution of data

1226
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,060
对于随机噪声
for random noises

1227
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,820
嗯嗯你2 d, 3 d l维恩的声音
there's uh uh your two d three d l dimensional uh noises

1228
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,660
他们拼写噪音旋度f b女士,您可以使用
they're spelling noise curl f b ms that you can use

1229
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,980
它是一件好事c p u g p u实现
it's it's a good thing to have a c p u and a g p u implementation

1230
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,740
所以你可以像开关迅速,您想要使用
so you can like switch quickly where you want to use

1231
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:21,940
他们
them

1232
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,720
嗯是抽样
uh was on this sampling

1233
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,440
是有用的分发
it's useful to distribute things

1234
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:29,810
我们真的这些都是斐波那契螺旋
our fibonacci spirals into the really all these are

1235
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:30,810
货物
the goods

1236
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,300
位置的初始结构
placement of your initial structure that are not

1237
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,780
在这种情况下只是随机的哦
just random uh in this case

1238
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,860
例如
for instance

1239
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,180
这基本上就是实例化后哦哦
this is basically instancing uh following uh one

1240
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,340
这些人实际上螺旋三维
of these people actually spiral on three d

1241
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,620
它使用呃一堆长矛
and it uses uh a bunch of spears

1242
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,300
颜色是担心机会
and the color is worried about chances

1243
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,100
所以这可能是像等离子体材质的玩具
so this could be like one of those shader toy plasmas

1244
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,900
只是它发生在这样的蛇
it's just that it's happening in this kind of snake

1245
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,300
它
it

1246
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,600
所以如果几何图形担心
so if geometries worried

1247
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,320
什么像你想要探索创造性
what like you want to be exploring creatively

1248
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,560
有很多的方法来做
there's many ways of doing

1249
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,560
你可以得到程序的方式就像撞三角形
you can get procedurally like just bumping triangles

1250
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,520
和脸
and faces

1251
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,920
您可以使用呃游行广场或多维数据集
you can use uh marching squares or marching cubes

1252
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,370
对我国
to our country

1253
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:10,530
呃
uh

1254
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,330
无论你想实现在c p u或g p u嗯嗯
whatever you want to implement uh on c p u or g p u um

1255
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,090
您可以使用s d f信号距离
you can use s d f signal distance

1256
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:20,530
未能创建你的你的你的结构
fails to create your your your your structures

1257
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,290
和隐式函数
and implicit functions

1258
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,230
这一个,例如,就像,呃创建。
this one, for instance, was about like, uh creating.

1259
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,650
这些是员工函数的函数
these are functions that employees functions that

1260
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,490
两个物体扭曲通过s d f和宏伟吗
are distorted through s d f and grandeur two objects

1261
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,050
我们正在行进中的多维数据集
we are marching cubes

1262
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,490
这就是整件事情
that was the the whole thing

1263
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,210
只是有一些光
just had some light

1264

一些材料
some material

1265
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,570
它看起来不错
and it looks nice

1266
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:39,970
嗯
um

1267
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,050
如果你想去剃须

00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:42,330
嗯
um

1270
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,930
没有需要准确的或物理
there's no need to be accurate or physical

1271
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:45,930
b b r
there's b b r

1272
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:46,690
这是很高兴
it's it's nice

1273

化妆真的很有用
makeup are really useful

1280
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:03,770
这种色调的垂直的地图吗
are this kind of of of shades vertical maps that

1281
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:07,130
如果你呃呃闪电闪电非常低廉
that if you uh lightning lightning very cheaply uh

1282
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:09,810
你可以使用f f x储蓄
you can use the f f x on your saving

1283
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:11,530
您可以使用属性
you can use the property

1284

以外的任何可能有点复杂
anything that might be a bit complicated outside

1286
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,300
of the a geometry
of the a geometry

1287
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,310
你可以用你可以尝试实现非逼真
you can use you can try to achieve non photorealistic

1288
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,710
渲染优化剃须草图
rendering tune shaving sketch

1289
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,790
你可以在这个很有创意
you can be very creative in in this

1290
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,310
一旦你得到你想要的东西来呈现
once you get something that you want to render

1291
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:32,750
还有方便的有几个
then there's there's it's convenient to have several

1292
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,190
渲染库函数
render libraries functions

1293
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:34,870
所以在这种情况下
so in this case

1294
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,590
例如
for instance

1295
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:36,030
呃
uh

1296
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,200
粒子或指出供应商真的很有用
particles or point out vendors are really useful

1297
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,800
甚至像我们作为你的价值
even like us as as the value of what do you have

1298
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,980
嗯像屏幕空间投影或网格线
uh or mesh lines which are like screen space projected

1299
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:46,220
行
lines

1300
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,900
所以他们更厚比常规的厚
so they're thicker they can be thicker than the regular

1301
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,420
呃web g l线
uh web g l lines

1302
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,420
或在这种情况下
or in this case

1303
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,100
有一个默认的是基于散射
there's a default lines were based on scattering

1304
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,860
点和积累或几帧
the dots and accumulating or a few frames

1305
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:00,540
这让这种耳语
so it gives this this kind of whisper

1306
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,980
吸烟。
smoking it.

1307
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,080
效果哦
effect uh

1308
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,040
一个品牌,现在我们有三种材质和体积
a volume branded now that we have three textures and

1309
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,240
流在你做什么材质
flow textures in what you do

1310
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,280
我们可以做哦
and we can do uh

1311
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:11,480
呃
uh

1312
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,360
很多东西也是真的
a lot of stuff is also really

1313
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,680
为调试非常有用哦不管你正在做的事情
really useful uh for debugging whatever you are doing

1314
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,720
甚至像建筑哦我们正如我们看到的东西
or even for like building uh something as we as we see

1315
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,560
基本上哦
which basically uh

1316
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,800
嗯
um

1317
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,120
东西非常的队列
something else is very much inside the queue for the

1318
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,600
球体呃三个探测器或悉尼的业务
sphere uh over a three detector or a sydney business

1319
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,000
建筑
building

1320
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:32,870
后期处理是一件大事,你也可以做
post processing is a big thing that you can also do

1321
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,510
有很多事情你可以做
there's there's so many things that you can do there

1322
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,790
它基本上是当你结束你的渲染
and it's basically when you get to the end of your render

1323
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:38,790
你有这样的感觉
and you feel like that

1324
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,190
错过一些打孔
it misses some punch

1325
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:40,630
呃
uh

1326
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,830
它很方便找到
it's it's it's convenient to like find something

1327
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:43,830
我应该像
like should i like

1328
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:44,750
提高水平
boost the levels

1329
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,830
我喜欢紧缩白人和基本上可以吗
could i like crunch the the whites and basically just

1330
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:51,350
去在photoshop中,你可能会做
go for the equivalent that you would might do in photoshop

1331
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,830
寻找方程哦
look for the equation uh

1332
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,030
通常在网上实现和
which are usually online and just implemented and

1333
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,150
添加到您的工具集组成一个接一个的繁荣
added to your tool set one after the other boom composition

1334
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:01,870
冠状病毒和你一样当你提升操作
coronavirus promoted operations as as you as you

1335
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:02,390
找到他们
find them

1336
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,990
或许有一件事是真的实现
maybe one thing is literally implemented

1337
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:08,310
桶形失真,或转变
the barrel distortion and or the shift

1338
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,080
去的。
and go with that.

1339
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,480
所以最后
so finally

1340
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,320
一些新的交易
some new deals

1341
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:13,480
呃
uh

1342
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,040
比如物理放松
things like physics for relaxation

1343
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:16,680
因为这个原因
for this reason

1344
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,040
东西也非常有用
things is also really useful

1345
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,200
呃
uh

1346
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,440
呃
uh

1347
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,520
你可以顺利创建的措施
you can you can smooth measures that you create out

1348
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,280
一个匹配的数据集等等
of a matching cubes and things like that

1349
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,960
你继续寻找你需要的东西,也许
you just keep finding things that you need and maybe

1350
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,240
找到如何如何实现它们
find how to how to implement them

1351
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:29,560
嗯
um

1352
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,800
这基本上是一个粒子系统品牌
this is basically a particle system branded with

1353
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,120
实例化之前,光和材料
instancing and the before the light and materials

1354
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,800
从三个j s阴影通过,您可以使用
from three j s shadow passes that you can use for for

1355
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,200
生成
generating

1356
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,920
像我提供材质
like uh i provide the shader

1357
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,160
我可以得到一个帧缓冲吗
can i get a frame buffer

1358
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,760
就是这样
that's it

1359
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,000
就像一个着色器,我可以使用嗯喂地图
it's like a shader that i can use uh to feed the maps

1360
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,320
嗯我一切的影子传递管道
of everything else uh on my pipeline shadow passes

1361
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,040
postperson或乒乓球传入你想要的结果
for postperson or ping pong passes in case you want

1362
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,640
做一些g p g p o
to do some g p g p o

1363
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,630
你需要像用在来回
and you need to like write in in the back and forth on

1364
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,230
相同的方法
the same method

1365
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,110
这是不允许的
which is not allowed

1366
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:01,350
所以你从一个另一个条目的方法
so you go from one method to the other entry

1367
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:02,550
嗯
um

1368
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:05,030
所以当我使用的工具
so when for tools that i use

1369
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:07,070
我使用这个工具为了像响应模式
i use the tool responsive mode in order to like

1370
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:10,630
需要解决和处理我想看到哦
take the resolution and handle what i want to see uh

1371
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:14,910
我用我的捕捉校园chrome扩展得到
i use my capture campus chrome extension to get the

1372
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,690
呃快照和g, g的顶部
uh snapshot and have a gigabyte and gigabyte top of

1373
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,930
我我所做的步骤
steps of my what i do

1374
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:24,410
我用来捕捉g s捕捉逐帧动画
i used to capture g s to capture frame by frame animations

1375
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:27,930
和事件像时不时b o年代快速输出
and events like every now and then o b s for a quick output

1376
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:32,060
所以说到具体的例子哦
so speaking of specific examples uh

1377
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:37,180
这是提示冷供应商叫吸引力
this is uh the prompt for cold vendor was called attraction

1378
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:41,460
而不是你在做经典的珊瑚噪音
and instead of you doing the classical coral noise

1379
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,340
我想重温你提供的东西
i wanted to revisit something that you offer

1380
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,520
让我们回去。
let's go back.

1381
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,270
我就去哦
i will go uh

1382
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:53,510
东西没用哦天是静电
something that didn't work uh back in day was was electrostatic

1383
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,310
呃收山
the charge uh charge hills

1384
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,380
所以,嗯
so um

1385
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,580
因为它是一个端到端问题
since it's an end to end problem

1386
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,020
这有点太贵为仿真计算哦
it's a bit too expensive to calculate uh for the simulation

1387
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,180
这是三个探测器变现
so it's cashed in a three detector

1388
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,940
然后推到的
and then it's pushed to the to the

1389
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:11,500
材质和中移动鼠标
to the shader and the charge that is moved in the mouse

1390
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,940
可以计算着色器,因为它是
that can be calculated in the shader because it's

1391
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,620
一两米
one two m

1392
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:18,020
这是负担得起的主题
which is uh affordable theme

1393
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,810
我可以停止这个聚会哦
can i stop this party uh

1394
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:24,250
这是一个g.b。gpu模拟与粒子
so it's a g.b.gpu simulation with with particles

1395
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:27,810
在生活中有位置和速度和质量
that have a position in life and velocity and mass

1396
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:30,210
他们只是在这些他们就像追踪
and they just they're just like traced across these

1397
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:31,530
字段
fields

1398
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:34,170
你可以随机
and you can randomize

1399
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,950
这基本上,你看到的是积累
and this that you're seeing is basically the accumulation

1400
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,270
粒子的哦
of particles uh

1401
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,550
有一个随机生成和梯度
there's a gradient that is randomly generated and

1402
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:43,790
通过材质作为两个检测器
pass the to the shader as a two detector

1403
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:46,670
得到亿万富翁位置的盒子
so you get billionaire position out of box

1404
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,830
最后,一些。
and finally, some.

1405
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:54,490
盛开在这戏剧性的操作比如发光效果
blooming for like glow effect in this dramatic operation 

1406
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,440
呃
uh

1407
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,040
另一个例子是这块石头
another example is this stone

1408
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:58,960
促进石
the promote stone

1409
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:04,610
石头本身是生成与单哦
so the the stone itself is generated uh with single

1410
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,370
距离字段和扭曲
distance fields and distortions

1411
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:07,560
所以这。
and so this.

1412
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,140
嗯
um

1413
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,620
有噪音的借贷支付这具体
there's borrowing noise to pay this concretely a

1414
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,790
表面呃f b m的两个分离和委员会
surface uh f b m's commission of two separations and

1415
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:17,830
这是计算的
it's calculated ones

1416
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:20,230
它挠在一分之一质感哦
and it's scratched in a in a texture uh

1417
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,630
所以它可以
so it can be it

1418
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,630
每次都是更昂贵的
it is more expensive to do every time

1419
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,720
基本上和过程生成的表面
and the process basically generates the the surface

1420
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,360
密码
password

1421
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,000
有数学的差距和法人团体的一员和环形照明
has the math gap and the corporator and the ring lighting

1422
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
法线和位置为了体积
and the normals and positions in order for the volume

1423
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,640
渲染
render

1424
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:40,730
三3月到三维燃烧噪音和获得
just three march into a three d burning noise and get

1425
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:41,290
这些内部
these interior

1426
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:42,690
就像闪闪发光的
which is like shimmering

1427
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,330
这是最后一个
and there's a final

1428
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:47,370
通过结合所有
pass that combines everything

1429
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:50,250
这是一个开花和post和一切
and that's a bit of bloom and post and everything

1430
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,650
所以你可以看到喜欢的不同
so you can see like the the different

1431
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:54,190
挡泥板的影响
effects of the mudguard

1432
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,510
这里有一个霜因素
there's there's like a frost factor

1433
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,670
这使得它更少啊
which makes it less ah

1434
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,550
祝福
blessing

1435
00:53:59,040 --> 00:53:59,400
呃
uh

1436
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,840
最后
and finally

1437
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,920
从昨天
from yesterday

1438
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,080
p r n g
there's the p r n g

1439
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,600
这是哦
which is uh

1440
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,000
是可视化呃随机所有这些工作
it was about visualizing uh random all this work

1441
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,520
right
right

1442
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,330
好吧
okay

1443
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:12,330
嗯
um

1444
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:14,410
这赛车像随机分布的数字
this racing like random distribution of numbers

1445
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:18,490
然后消息实例信息的分布
so then message of instance messages are distributed

1446
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:19,410
用毒药
with a poison

1447
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,210
this sampling over here
this sampling over here

1448
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:21,850
放松一点
relax the bit

1449
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:23,290
所以他们不重叠
so they don't overlap

1450
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:29,760
模具模型是一个g l t f模型和它的使用多渲染
the die model is a g l t f model and it's using multi render

1451
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,280
这些目标筛选接种
target for these screening space of inoculation

1452
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,080
这是非常好的,我们可以换一个吗
which is really nice that we can do that in one

1453
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,280
零
zero

1454
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:34,480
两个
two

1455
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:35,390
呃
uh

1456
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,470
它是利用多示例渲染目标
it's using multi sample to render targets for the

1457
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,350
color pass you get uh smooth image
color pass you get uh smooth image

1458
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:44,990
and you don't need to use f x a a or any other processing
and you don't need to use f x a a or any other processing

1459
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,410
嗯。
um.

1460
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:50,100
是嗯和组合
and the combination is the um

1461
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,100
屏幕空间
the screen space

1462
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,900
类似的问题这嗯嗯阴影,不错
similar question that's this uh nice um shadows and

1463
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,940
全球消除的
and kind of global elimination

1464
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,420
+常规3 g s浅滩呃结合一切
plus the regular three g s shallows uh combine everything

1465
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,620
成一个最终的价格处理
into one final price of processing

1466
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,440
嗯
um

1467
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:04,840
